1. Data Understanding and Exploration
Dataset: Use the Wine Quality dataset, which contains features like acidity, sugar, pH, etc., and a quality score.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the distribution of features, identify outliers, and visualize relationships between features and the target variable (quality).
2. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Ensure there are no missing values or handle them appropriately.
Feature Scaling: Standardize or normalize features to ensure they are on a similar scale.
Encoding Categorical Variables: If there are any categorical features, encode them using techniques like one-hot encoding.
3. Feature Engineering
Feature Selection: Identify important features using techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance from models.
Creating New Features: Based on domain knowledge, create new features that might help improve the model.
4. Model Selection
Choice of Algorithms: Try different algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
Baseline Model: Start with a simple model to establish a baseline performance.
5. Model Training and Evaluation
Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
Evaluation Metrics: Use appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared for regression tasks.
